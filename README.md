# Human-Text-To-Speech
* Purpose: This program takes in a string input and then "speaks" out what was written by the person by accessing audio files of each word spoken by said person.  This was made so that people wouldn't have to use text to speech programs that sound robotic and not like the person speaking.  This way a person can keep their voice without having to physically talk.

* Operation: This is done by parsing each word entered in the text line and then finding 
the corresponding .wav file for each word in the "AudioFiles" folder.  To add
your words into the program, please add them to the "AudioFiles" folder and 
make sure that the .wav file is titled with the word being said.
 
* Audio files located at: C:/Users/Robert/eclipse-workspace/HumanTextToSpeech/AudioFiles/
