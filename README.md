# Human-Text-To-Speech
Purpose: This program takes in a string input and then "speaks" out what was written by the person by accessing audio files of each word spoken by said person.  This was made so that people wouldn't have to use text to speech programs that sound robotic and not like the person speaking.  This way a person can keep their voice without having to physically talk.
